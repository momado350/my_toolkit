## Setting Up SQLite
Binaries for SQLite can be installed at the SQLite Download page.

Windows
For Windows machines:

Download the sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3200100.zip file and unzip it.
From your git-bash terminal, open the directory of the unzipped folder with cd ~/Downloads/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3200100/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3200100/.
Try running sqlite with the command winpty ./sqlite3.exe. If that command opens a sqlite> prompt, congratulations! You’ve installed SQLite.
We want to be able to access this command quickly from elsewhere, so we’re going to create an alias to the command. Exit the sqlite> prompt by typing in Ctrl + C, and in the same git-bash terminal without changing folders, run these commands:

echo "alias sqlite3=\"winpty ${PWD}/sqlite3.exe\"" >> ~/.bashrc

and

source ~/.bashrc

The first command will create the alias sqlite3 that you can use to open a database. The second command will refresh your terminal so that you can start using this command. Try typing in the command sqlite3 newdb.sqlite. If you’re presented with a sqlite> prompt, you’ve successfully created the sqlite3 command for your terminal. Enter Ctrl + C to quit. You can also exit by typing .exit in the prompt and pressing Enter.
